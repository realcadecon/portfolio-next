## Welcome to my portfolio project! [Check it out here](https://cadeconner.com)
This site was lovingly built with a wide variety of tech, some old some new (to me), and I'm really happy with the result! 

### Cool Things I Learned
- All animated bits on this site were custom made and animated using Rive. This was my first experience with computer animation, but I enjoyed it so much I decided to start learning blender!
- All video files are stored in an S3 bucket and the links are saved in my postgres DB. I have studied the architecture of handling and serving large BLOB content, but this was my first time implementing it and it turned out great!

### Tech Stack
1. Language & Library: Typescript, React
2. Framework: NextJS
3. Animation & Design: Rive
4. Page Animations: GSAP
5. Hosting and Edge Functions: Vercel
6. Object Store: AWS S3
7. Database & ORM: PostgreSQL w/ Drizzle ORM
